All of our data is from (https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis/nhl-game-data). If data is not included, please visit this site
and download: 'game.csv', 'game_teams_stats.csv', and 'team_info.csv'. Then you will place those files into a folder with the
two python modules 'main.py' and 'data_process.py'. To reproduce our results, all you need to do is save both modules in your
editor of choice, then run 'main.py' with the terminal command 'python main.py'. This will output all of the plots we used in our analysis to the folder you ran 'main.py' in. If you would like to experiment with our machine learning algorithm, feel free to enter different years (format: 20XX0XX -> see example in main.py for exact format) which will predict the playoffs for that inputed year. "Experimenting" with our machine learning algorithm is only for fun, and is not part of our actual project, so if problems arise using the method outside of what we personally wrote (hopefully they don't), please keep that in mind. Enjoy!
